Richard Liloia here! I'm originally from Morristown, New Jersey, and am back living here once again.
I'm really into sports, especially soccer, tennis, skiing, etc. I studied Finance at Bryant University, in Rhode Island.
I'm taking this course to see if this is a career field I would be good at, and/or enjoy, so we'll see!
I'm looking forward to getting started, and getting to know everyone.
